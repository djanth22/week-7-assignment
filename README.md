## reflection

# requirements achieved

- client was created using react
- express was used to create a server that both has GET and POST endpoints
- a form was built using react for users to create posts/feedback
- i have created multiple pages by using components in react and navigating through them using react router
- a database was set up and seeded with realistic dummy data
- posts were retrieved from the database to the express server using SQL
- posts are rendered and displayed using .map()

# other reflection points

I seemed to have some initial trouble with the rendering of the database data, and later posting the data. It turned out this was simply due to code I had made note of but hadn't yet integrated. Unfortunately, this did eat up a lot of my time trying to fix before realising what the problem was. As a result I decided to keep this guestbook very simple. I had some plans of attempting some of the stretch goals for this project, but after a full day of faffing and little progress as a result of the aforementioned forgetfulness/mistake I decided I'd be better off simplifying things.
